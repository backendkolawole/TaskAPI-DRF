Task manager API built using Django and . 
It follows a RESTFul API design architecture. It's richly built django-rest-authemail. 
django-rest-authemail is a Django/Python application that provides a RESTful API interface for user signup and authentication. Email addresses are used for authentication, rather than usernames. Because the authentication user model is based on Django's AbstractBaseUser and is itself abstract, the model can be extended without the need for additional database tables. Token authentication allows the API to be accessed from a variety of front ends, including Django, React and AngularJS clients, and iOS and Android mobile apps.
